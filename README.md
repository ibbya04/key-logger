# Simple Keylogger Project

This is a basic keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` library. It records keyboard input and saves it to a log file.

## Features
- Logs every key pressed.
- Saves logs to `out/log.txt`.
- Converts spacebar presses to new lines.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pynput
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python keylogger.py
   ```
3. Check the `out/log.txt` file for logged keystrokes.
